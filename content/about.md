### Under Construction

Do you ever feel like you spend more time checking the weather for your favorite outdoor hobby than you do working during the week?
Crosscast is a forecasting aggregator that aims to make it easy to compare the weather across a variety of Zones, so you can see where the powder will be deepest or the winds most favorable!
